Calculate edit distance (Levenshtein distance) 

- Calculate the Levenshtein distance between all pairs of domain names in two input files.
- Output the results in a TSV file for easy analysis.

### Usage

1. Install the required Python library:

   ```shell
   pip install python-Levenshtein
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```shell
   python calculate_edit_distance.py file1.txt file2.txt output.tsv
   ```

   - `file1.txt`: Path to the first file containing domain names.
   - `file2.txt`: Path to the second file containing domain names.
   - `output.tsv`: Path to the output TSV file.
